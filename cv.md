 3. At  the  moment, my  goal  is to improve  my  knowledge  and  skills  about  HTML  and  CSS,  as  well as learn  JS.  My  priorities  are to spend  several  hours  a  day  practicing  coding  and  developing my own  pet  projects. My strengths are the ability to think creatively systematize the process of work or training. As well as such important qualities as being broad-minded in solving problems and communicating with people, which speeds up and improves the quality of work. At the moment I have no achievements in competitions yet, but I am very motivated and strive to achieve them. I am actively working to develop my skills and knowledge in order to achieve high results in the future.
